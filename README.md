# What is Stepper-motor-synchronization

Stepper motor synchronization means we made physically, electrically & by programming a set for stepper motors which runs in perfect synch, in this system we have one master stepper motor and one slave stepper motor.

So the slave motor precisely follow the the moves of master stepper motor.
They follow each other step by step. 
For this we have to program master and slave separately, the main point here is that we achieve this
Complex motion by using only Arduino and custom PCB, not fancy PLC or controller needed.
To achieve such precision we need our system also to be accurate for this Custom PCBs from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT) really helps us.

# Circuit


Power connections

This is the basic circuit by which we can control stepper motor via a4988 stepper motor 
The driver requires a logic supply voltage (3 â€“ 5.5 V) to be connected across the VDD and GND pins and a motor supply voltage (8 â€“ 35 V) to be connected across VMOT and GND. These supplies should have appropriate decoupling capacitors close to the board, 

and they should be capable of delivering the expected currents (peaks up to 4 A for the motor supply).

Control inputs

Each pulse to the STEP input corresponds to one microstep of the stepper motor in the direction selected by the DIR pin. Note that the STEP and DIR pins are not pulled to any particular voltage internally, so you should not leave either of these pins floating in your application. If you just want rotation in a single direction, you can tie DIR directly to VCC or GND. The chip has three different inputs for controlling its many power states: RST, SLP, and EN. For details about these power states, see the datasheet. Please note that the RST pin is floating; if you are not using the pin, you can connect it to the adjacent SLP pin on the PCB to bring it high and enable the board.

By following such basics of A44988 we designe a Custom PCB so that we not need to wire whole things again and again.

First of all I take some 20 x 20 aluminium profile, and make the base of the machine out of it.
I used right angle bracket to joints the corners.

Then I bring 2 8mm SS smooth rod. And 4 qty of 8mm linear bearings.
2 bearings is for master and 2 bearing is for slave. Our whole stepper motor arrangement will slide back and forth on this.

Here I have Nema 17 stepper motors the reason of using such motor because stepper motors are very precise many times not any feedback system required to controlling steps. 

Specifitaction of motor
Step Angle: 1.8 Â°
Current: 1.2 A/Phase
Holding Torque: 5.6 kg-cm
Detent torque: 2.8 N.cm (Maximum)
Lead Wires: 4
Shaft diameter: 5 mm(D-type)

Now the back side of stepper motors control the linear motion of stepper motor.
I have placed GT2 pulley to the shaft of both stepper motors.
And I placed a GT2 timing belt along the length of track of the profile.
And I engage the timing belt with the GT2 pulley of stepper motor with the help of 2 dummy pulleys.
So when shaft of motor rotate the whole whole system will slide accordingly.
