# What is Stepper-motor-synchronization

Stepper motor synchronization means we made physically, electrically & by programming we made a set for stepper motors which runs in perfect synch, in this system we have one master stepper motor and one slave stepper motor.

So the slave motor precisely follow the the moves of master stepper motor.
They follow each other step by step. 
For this we have to program master and slave separately, the main this is that we achieve this
Complex motion by using only Arduino and custom PCB, not fancy PLC or controller needed.
To achieve such precision we need our system also to be accurate for this Custom PCBs from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT) really helps us.
